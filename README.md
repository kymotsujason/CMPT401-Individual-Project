# CMPT401 Individual Project
This is an AR app for the Android (7.0+) using Google's ARcore.
The goal is to teach university students to learn to code.

Current stage: Framework is there, need to add more interactivity and polish.

Installation instructions:
1) Download the APK
2) Transfer it to your device
3) Install the APK (make sure to enable "unknown sources")

How to use:
1) On opening the application, you'll be greeted with text about searching for surfaces.
You need to point the device's camera towards a flat surface and slowly point towards all objects near it to map out the play area.
2) Once you see the white grid appear, either tap where you want to set as the center or continue to map out a bit more area. Before you select the area, hover the phone directly over the center before tapping the screen at that location.
3) Now you should see some models appear and a menu. Select play to see all level options.

How to play:
1) After choosing a level to play, you'll see some boxes along with some text. All you need to do is move the text into the empty boxes, but in the correct order. Move the text into the correct boxes (order-wise).
2) You should hear a sound when you've put the text in the correct order. The models should also move (buggy/not working). 
3) Press the "back to menu" button to return to the menu.
